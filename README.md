### Pattern Definition

The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. 
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

### Project Topic

1.. Most of the project code is taken from the book and implemented in the project 
	using the Web Form ListView user interface.
2.. To give you an overview of the strategy template, the UML of the "Head First Design Patterns" 
	book Strategy pattern "strategy_class_diagram.png" is placed in the project's root folder.
